# Specs from Nord Safety

The task is to write a small Hacker News Client. We’d like to see the following features in the client:

* user should be able to list best stories on Hacker News.
* user should be able to read the comments related to individual stories.

The client should be implemented using React and TypeScript. Please share the code using tools you see fit. It’s intended to be a fairly small task as we don’t want to take up too much of your time.
